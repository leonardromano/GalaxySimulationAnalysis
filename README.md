# GalaxySimulationAnalysis
Python 2 code that helps analysing the simulation data(only hdf5) of galaxy simulations created with gadget.

For the code to run the following packages are needed:

1. yt (Download from http://yt-project.org/doc/about/index.html) (version 3.6 or numPy older than 1.6)

2. pygadgetreader (Download from https://bitbucket.org/rthompson/pygadgetreader/overview)

3. hdf5

A detailled description can be found in my Bachelor's thesis, which is also available here.
